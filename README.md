# CheckAllCiphers.sh
Try to decrypt a file with all ciphers in OpenSSL given an encrypted file and the private key.

This does not take arguments, so you can either change your private key and encrypt file names to match the shell script, or you can change the shell script references to match the file names.

If you have a password instead of a private key file, just replace "file:./private_key.pem" with your password string.
